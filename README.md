# Ensemble Learning Techniques and Algorithms

Welcome to the Ensemble Learning Techniques and Algorithms repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of various ensemble learning techniques and algorithms implemented in Python.

## What is Ensemble Learning?

Ensemble learning is a powerful machine learning paradigm that combines the predictions of multiple base learners to improve overall performance. It leverages the wisdom of crowds by aggregating the predictions of diverse models to produce more accurate and robust predictions than any individual model.

## Algorithms Included

This repository contains implementations of the following ensemble learning algorithms:

1. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**
2. **Random Forest**
3. **Boosting Algorithms:**
   - AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)
   - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
   - XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
   - LightGBM
   - CatBoost
4. **Stacking**
5. **Voting Classifiers**
6. **Ensemble Pruning**
7. **Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA)**
8. **Bayesian Model Combination (BMC)**
9. **Ensemble Selection**

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script or Jupyter Notebook within the repository. Simply navigate to the respective algorithm's file to view its implementation details, usage examples, and performance evaluation.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have implemented a new ensemble learning algorithm or have suggestions for improvements to existing implementations, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
